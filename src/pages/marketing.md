          A Facebook Ad can cost 76 rupees which is approximately $ 1.5 per day
          to advertise in India. YouTube will cost at least $10 per day for
          local campaigns. So, if we post 2 Ads per week in Facebook it might
          cost us approximately $9 for a month of Facebook advertising. Also
          assume we posted a video on YouTube only on weekends. It would cost us
          $80 per month with least amount. Together digital marketing budget for
          one year is around $1200
