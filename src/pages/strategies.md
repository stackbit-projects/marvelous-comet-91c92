          Now THAT is true, but we love web development even more. We talk about
          it on our blog, like, [a lot](http://bit.ly/2YA6999). We often craft
          live demos and open source these bad boys [on
          GitHub](https://github.com/snipcart). Matter of fact, this Planty
          theme [is open source
          too](https://github.com/snipcart/stackbit-theme-planty)! If you spot
          any bugs, open an issue, and we’ll fire our junior dev. Just kidding
          Michael, you’re good.
